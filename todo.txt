  # Migration
  
  ## Awesome
  
  Let's use Awesome WM until the wayland ecosystem is mature.
  
  ## Wayland
  
  - river wm
    - wait until...
      - more than 1100 commits (1030 now)
      - more than 500 closed issues (473 now)
      - version 0.3.0 (0.2.4 now)
  - polybar doesn't support wayland
  - rofi doesn't officially support wayland, but it has an unofficial fork
  - no picom in wayland, but I guess it doesn't need one
